## CURVE
### Geological Petrographic Analysis Tool
Curve is a Geological Petrographic Analysis Tool that was originally created by Godfried Wasser, whom is now deceased. This was a closed source endeavour, and @HotNoob was contracted to cleanup, optimize and make the software ready for distribution and sale. Godfried Wasser passed away before the software was officially released.
This software is to be released to the public as there is no future plans to further develope it. 

So here we have it. 

It is for free for everyone to enjoy...

 As the programmer who rewrote all of this... i have no idea how to use it... i just managed to get by via deciphering the spaghetti code... so... good luck!
