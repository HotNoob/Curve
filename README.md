## CURVE
### Geological Petrographic Analysis Tool
Curve is a Geological Petrographic Analysis Tool that was originally created by Godfried Wasser, whom is now deceased. This was a closed source endeavour, and @HotNoob was contracted to cleanup, optimize and make the software ready for distribution and sale. Godfried Wasser passed away before the software was officially released. The executors of the estate have come to an agreement that it is best to release this software to the public as there is no future plans to further develope it. 

So here we have it. 

The planned licensing was to be $10000/seat/year and here it is for free for everyone to enjoy...

 As the programmer who rewrote all of this... i have no idea how to use it... i just managed to get by via deciphering the spaghetti code... so... good luck!
